## [0.1.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Twig override priority for the `@ContentBlocksKit` namespace.** The bundle no longer manually registers its `templates/` path under its own Twig namespace — this was duplicating Symfony's `AbstractBundle` auto-detection and inserting the vendor path with higher priority than the host app's `templates/bundles/ContentBlocksKitBundle/` override directory, effectively disabling the standard override mechanism. Override directories now work as documented.
